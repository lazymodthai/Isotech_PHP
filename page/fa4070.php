TSI's Certifier FA (4070) Ventilator Tester is the best way to test ventilators, oxygen concentrators and other respiratory and flow devices. It is a complete measurement solution for air, oxygen and nitrous oxide.<br>
 <br>
If you desire to measure pressure at higher pressures, we recommend the DPM-235175NNFC, also available from BC Group. It will economically add higher pressure capability to your Certifier-FA ventilator tester. Even with this additional investment, your total cost is still significantly less than competing ventilator testers. <br>
