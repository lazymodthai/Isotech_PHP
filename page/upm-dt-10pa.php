OHMIC Instruments Models UPM-DT-1PA & 10PA are precision wattmeters designed to measure the power output of diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound transducers. The UPM-DT series have been in use worldwide since 1986 and conform to the testing guidelines recommended by FDA, JCAHO, AAMI and AIUM. Power is measured by the radiation methodand the accuracy of the UPM-DT’s are traceable to NIST.<br>
