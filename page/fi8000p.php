The Riken FI-8000P Anesthetic Gas Indicator (sometimes referred to as the
FI-8000) measures vaporizer output concentration using a digital display and
does not require correction factors. Measures concentration in percentage for
Desflurane (Suprane), Sevoflurane, Isoflurane (Forane) and Halothane. The
battery operated FI-8000 allows the user to select the carrier gas (O2 or Air)
and has an internal pump. (The FI-8000P is the direct replacement for the
previous FI-21 Model that is no longer available.)<br />
