The AA-8000 is the latest in portable anesthetic agent analyzers. It was
designed to meet the demand for a small, easy to use unit with high reliability
and accuracy. Utilizing proprietary state-of-the-art digital NDIR
(Non-Dispersive Infrared) Technology it provides a low cost, high function,
microprocessor-based analyzer that is simple to operate while maintaining high
performance and accuracy.<br />
<br />
The unit’s flexible design and portable size makes it the ideal service tool for
anesthesia service applications in hospitals and surgical centers. It has a
slanted display and adjustable handle/stand to allow for ease of viewing. The
internal rechargeable Lithium battery provides for hours of continuous
operation.<br />
<br />
One button selection of the agent to be analyzed coupled with one button control
over the sampling pump make the unit simple and quick to use. No complex menus
and key combinations are required. The internal data logger combined with the
internal clock allows for the storage of up to 250 time and date stamped
readings, that can be downloaded to a computer using the USB interface.<br />
